This will be the first in a series of blog posts — or at least that’s the plan.  
I’ve spent the last few days putting in a handful of hours here and there to get this blog application up and running.

It might seem a bit silly not to just use WordPress, Jekyll, Hugo, or one of the many other ready-made options out there. But I usually prefer doing things my own way, even if it takes a bit more time. Luckily, with all the recent progress in AI coding assistants, it didn’t actually take that long to piece everything together.

If anyone's curious, I'm sure I'll share more details about how I built the blog on the [About page](/about), or you can check out the [GitHub repo][repo].

I already have a few ideas lined up for posts in the near future, so it probably won't be long before the next one shows up.
