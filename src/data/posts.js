But I usually prefer doing things my own way, even if it takes a bit more time. Luckily, with all the recent progress in AI coding assistants, it didn’t actually take that long to piece everything together.</p>\n<p>If anyone&#39;s curious, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll share more details about how I built the blog on the <a href=\"/about\">About page</a>, or you can check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/LudvigAlmvaang/blog.almvaang.com\">GitHub repo</a>.</p>\n<p>I already have a few ideas lined up for posts in the near future, so it probably won&#39;t be long before the next one shows up.</p>\n"
